        <p>Home security includes both the security hardware placed on a property and individuals' personal security practices. Security hardware includes doors, locks, alarm systems, lighting, motion detectors, and security camera systems. Personal security involves practices like ensuring doors are locked, alarms are activated, owning a Dog, windows are closed, and extra keys are not hidden outside.

According to an FBI report, 58.3% of burglaries in the United States involved forcible entry. Per the most recent statistics, the average burglary in the United States takes about 90 seconds to 12 minutes, and on average, a burglar will break into a home within 60 seconds.[1][2] Most target cash first followed by jewels, drugs, and electronics.[3] Common security methods include never hiding extra keys outside, never turning off all the lights, applying small CCTV stickers on doors, and keeping good tabs with neighbours.[4]</p>
